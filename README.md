This repository demonstrates an example of an unhandled exception in TypeScript. The `bug.ts` file contains a set of arithmetic functions, including a division function that throws an error if the divisor is zero. The main part of the code calls these functions, but fails to catch the potential error thrown by the `divide` function. This can lead to a runtime exception.  The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to correctly handle the exception using a `try...catch` block.
